# SIRI Hub v4 (with Copilot)
Static institute site that aggregates multiple repos *and* includes a built‑in Copilot to create Knowledge Objects (KOs) as GitHub PRs.

## What’s inside
- `site/`
  - `index.html` — home (cards from `registry/repos.json`)
  - `kos.html` — searchable KO registry (reads `site/data/ko-registry.json` if present)
  - `copilot.html` — create KO → branch+commit+PR via GitHub API (token pasted at runtime)
  - `styles.css`, `js/app.js`, `js/search.js`, `js/gh.js`
  - `data/` — place `ko-registry.json` here (generated by script below)
- `registry/repos.json` — list of your repos for the homepage
- `scripts/aggregate_kos.py` — builds a unified KO registry from local repo clones
- Deployment: GitHub Pages workflow + Vercel/Netlify configs

## Quickstart
1) Edit `registry/repos.json` with your real repo URLs.  
2) (Optional) Build registry:  
   `python scripts/aggregate_kos.py --roots ../path-to-repos …`  
   (Commits `site/data/ko-registry.json` for search.)  
3) Push to GitHub. GitHub Pages workflow deploys `/site` automatically.

**Security:** Copilot uses a Personal Access Token you paste only when you use it; it is never stored by the page. Use minimal scope and revoke when done.
