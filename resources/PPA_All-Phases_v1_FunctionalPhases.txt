FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The invention relates to integrated energy and water systems. More specifically, it concerns a plasma-assisted catalytic ammonia cracker, a hydrogen-fueled propulsion/power stage, a condenser for water recovery, and a waste-heat desalination unit arranged as a cascading energy ladder that minimizes exergy loss while producing potable water and useful power.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Ammonia (NH3) is produced at global scale and is recognized as a promising hydrogen carrier. Conventional catalytic cracking of ammonia typically requires elevated temperatures (≥600 °C) and is deployed as a stand-alone process, often wasting the high-grade heat available downstream in combustion. In parallel, desalination technologies—reverse osmosis (RO), multi-stage flash (MSF), multiple-effect distillation (MED), and mechanical vapor compression (MVC)—are energy-intensive when operated independently and usually do not benefit from upstream high-temperature sources.
Existing propulsion and stationary power systems discharge most of their heat to the environment without using it for water harvesting or desalination. There is therefore a need for a compact, modular apparatus that: (i) lowers the electrical burden of producing hydrogen from ammonia via plasma-assisted catalysis and thermal recuperation; (ii) uses the hydrogen for propulsion or electricity; (iii) recovers water from exhaust and ambient air; and (iv) drives desalination primarily with otherwise-wasted heat. 

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention is a four-phase, thermally integrated system comprising: (1) a plasma-assisted catalytic ammonia cracker that produces a hydrogen-rich gas and a high-grade heat source; (2) a propulsion or power generation unit that combusts the hydrogen-rich gas (with air or oxygen) and provides a hot exhaust stream; (3) a condenser (“Condensation Stage”) that recovers water from the hot moist exhaust or ambient air using low-grade heat and plasma-enhanced interfacial control; and (4) a desalination module that uses the remaining heat in an OTSG/flash evaporator coupled to a mechanical vapor compression (MVC) or membrane distillation (MD) loop, optionally followed by salinity-gradient energy recovery (pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) or reverse electrodialysis (RED)).
A supervisory controller prioritizes catalyst health and safety, then allocates thermal duty to desalination and condensation while maintaining stable propulsion/power output. The modules are physically and functionally modular, each operable standalone or together as a cascading energy ladder.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

Overview and Operating Temperatures
The system harvests heat in descending temperature tiers: Tier A (≈600–900 °C) for cracking and primary recuperation; Tier B (≈200–400 °C) for flash evaporation and preheating; Tier C (≈60–120 °C) for MVC/MD latent recycling; Tier D (<70 °C) for condensing economization and ambient water harvesting. The electrical domain supports control, pumping, compression, and low-duty plasma excitation. All temperature values are exemplary and may vary with materials and catalysts.

PHASE 1 — PLASMA-ASSISTED AMMONIA CRACKER (Hydrogen Source + High-Grade Heat)
1. Reactor Geometry: A tubular or annular fixed-bed reactor with 1–3 mm hydraulic-diameter channels containing catalysts such as Ru/Al2O3, Ru/MgO, and/or Co–Mo nitrides. A dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma sleeve surrounds the reactor wall to promote non-thermal excitation, lower light-off temperature, and accelerate kinetics.
2. Thermal Modes: A low-duty plasma preheat raises the bed to ≈350–500 °C. Thereafter, a primary recuperator transfers heat from a downstream hot exhaust stream to maintain ≈450–650 °C bulk bed temperature. Residence times 10–300 ms; gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) 10,000–50,000 h−1.
3. Heat Recovery: Integrated hot-side jacket or embedded plate-fin recuperator recovers ≥60% of usable enthalpy for (i) preheating incoming NH3 and (ii) supplying Tier B heat to the desalination OTSG.
4. Gas Handling: The H2/N2 product can be routed (a) directly to the combustor/augmentor for propulsion/power or (b) through hydrogen-selective membranes (e.g., palladium alloy) or PSA for market-grade hydrogen. NH3 slip is controlled by a polishing catalyst downstream of the reactor.
5. Materials: Inconel 600/625 or 310/253MA for hot sections; 316L SS for cool manifolds; graphite/metal C-ring seals. Lubricants are isolated from the gas path; oil-free bearings used where applicable.
6. Instrumentation & Controls: Axial thermocouples (multiple points), inlet/outlet pressures, NH3 slip sensor, plasma power and frequency control, and a hot-gas bypass valve that prioritizes the cracker’s target bed temperature over downstream heat demands.

PHASE 2 — AMMONIA-CRACKING THRUSTER ENGINE (Propulsion/Power + Counterflow Recuperation)
1. Two-Chamber Continuous Flow: (a) Cracking chamber per Phase 1 – Ammonia Synthesis Stage outputs hot H2/N2; (b) Combustor/augmentor (preferably lean-premixed, catalytically stabilized) mixes with air or oxygen for thrust or shaft power.
2. Counterflow Heat Exchange: Exhaust from the combustor transfers heat in a primary recuperator to sustain the cracker’s enthalpy requirement with minimal external electrical heat.
3. Steam Augmentation: A once-through steam generator (OTSG) flashes seawater on the cold side of a corrosion-resistant heat exchanger to clean steam using Tier B heat. Steam is injected into the augmentor to increase mass flow and reduce NOx, and/or routed to the desalination condenser to recycle latent heat.
4. Output Modes: (i) Reaction nozzle (jet thrust); (ii) Microturbine for Brayton-cycle electric generation with shaft alternator; (iii) Mechanical shaft for propulsors. The alternator supplies a DC bus for controls and auxiliaries.
5. Emissions Management: NOx suppression via lean premix, steam injection (steam-to-fuel mass ratio 0.5–1.5), and catalytic liners. NH3 slip minimized upstream.
6. Performance Targets (non-limiting): ≥30–35% electrical/shaft efficiency (small generator mode). In jet mode, specific impulse ≥300 s depending on pressure ratio and steam fraction.

PHASE 3 — CONDENSER / AETHERWELL (Water Condensation & Micro-Energy Harvesting)
1. Condensation Stack: A vertical column with staged hydrophilic fins and a demister pad cools hot moist exhaust by counterflow air or coolant. Plasma (DBD/corona) upstream enhances nucleation and provides antimicrobial action without electrodes in the wet path.
2. Dual-Mode Operation: When the engine/combustor is idling or offline, ambient air (RH 20–100%) is drawn through the column for atmospheric water harvesting. Low-grade heat (Tier D) maintains favorable dewpoint approach.
3. Condensate Harvesting & Micro-Power: Condensate drains into multi-volume tipping buckets that trigger reed/Hall sensors. Each tip drives (a) a flyback-boost energy harvester and/or (b) a miniature impulse wheel coupled to a coreless generator. Pulsed energy charges a supercapacitor to actuate latching valves and power low-duty sensors and telemetry. Energy is modest (millijoules–joules per tip) but sufficient for controls.
4. Water Quality & Maintenance: Distillate typically 0–10 ppm TDS; optional remineralization for potability. Periodic warm freshwater rinse and controlled brine bleed avoid scaling; materials include titanium Grade 2 or duplex stainless on seawater sides.

PHASE 4 — WASTE-HEAT DESALINATION (Flash + MVC/MD + Economizer + Optional Salinity Power)
1. Heat Ladder Utilization: Post-combustor exhaust flows through (i) primary recuperator (to Phase 1 – Ammonia Synthesis Stage), (ii) OTSG/flash evaporator (seawater→clean steam), (iii) mid-grade preheater for process streams, and (iv) condensing economizer to recover latent heat into incoming feeds.
2. Desalination Core: Mechanical Vapor Compression (MVC) and/or Membrane Distillation (MD). MVC compressor pressure ratio ≈1.2–1.4 provides an 8–15 K temperature lift between evaporator and condenser; latent heat is recycled to minimize electrical consumption.
3. Plasma Antifouling: DBD modules at evaporation interfaces reduce biofouling and alter interfacial energy for higher mass transfer without chemical dosing.
4. Salinity-Gradient Energy Recovery (optional): Distillate and brine streams feed PRO or RED modules to recover ≈0.3–1.5 kWh/m3 of product water.
5. Controls & Quality: Supervisory control enforces cracker temperature priority, modulates hot-gas bypass, throttles MVC via VFD, maintains brine recovery to keep saturation index <0.2, and diverts distillate if conductivity exceeds threshold (e.g., 20 µS/cm).
6. Performance (illustrative): Effective electricity consumption (SEC) ≤3 kWh/m3 with tight integration; ≤1.5–2.5 kWh/m3 under abundant waste heat. Product cost targets ≤$0.001–$0.0015/L at scale (site-dependent).

MATERIALS AND SAFETY
Hot gas-side: Inconel 600/625 or 310/253MA; wet seawater-side: titanium Grade 2 or duplex stainless; gaskets: EPDM/FKM; seals: metal or graphite C-rings. Chlorides are isolated from red-hot metals to avoid hot corrosion. Relief valves, demisters, NOx/NH3 sensors, and interlocks protect against over-temperature/over-pressure and product-quality excursions.

CONTROL ARCHITECTURE (Representative)
1. Cracker Bed Temperature PID — controls hot-gas bypass to maintain ≈500–650 °C. 
2. MVC VFD Control — holds ΔT(cond−evap) ≈10 K (typical range 8–15 K). 
3. Plasma Duty PID — modulates based on ORP/UV254 biofouling proxies at evaporation/condensation interfaces. 
4. Brine Recovery Loop — maintains saturation index <0.2 via bleed valve and periodic warm rinse. 
5. Condensate-Triggered Tasks — tipping-bucket interrupts run the flyback harvester, increment energy counters, and actuate bi-stable valves without continuous coil power.

EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS (Non-limiting)
Example A (Bench Unit): 1 m3/day desalination using 15–30 kWth exhaust; OTSG 10–20 kWth; MVC shaft 0.5–1.2 kW; SEC 3–5 kWh/m3; distillate ≤10 ppm TDS.
Example B (Pilot): 10 m3/day with 100–200 kWth exhaust; MVC shaft 2–5 kW; SEC ≤3 kWh/m3; RED/PRO recovery ≈0.5 kWh/m3.
Example C (Thruster): Continuous H2/N2 combustor with steam injection (steam-to-fuel 0.8), NOx <25 ppm at 15% O2 dry, microturbine electrical efficiency 30–35%.
Example D (Membrane-Shift Cracker): Palladium-alloy tube in annular reactor removes H2 in situ, achieving >99% NH3 conversion at 500–550 °C at GHSV ~15,000 h−1.

ADVANTAGES
