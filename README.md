# Crown of Tyme Repository

This repository is the **Crown of Tyme** – a unified portal and knowledge lattice forged from many separate modules and prototypes.  It consolidates the Sovereign‑Intelligence family of projects into a coherent structure with a clear architectural rhythm.  At the centre of this repository is a simple `index.html` which acts as the gateway for exploring the various components.  Everything is organised into a handful of top‑level directories, each representing an organ of the greater system.

The aim of the Crown of Tyme is to provide a living, breathing environment where new ideas, scrolls, agents and applications can be born and easily accessed.  The name reflects both the temporal aspect of the work (tracking 365‑day cycles, preserving knowledge) and the sovereign, crown‑like authority of the Codex.  A companion “Curious Incorporate” agent will eventually monitor this repository, ingest new scrolls and tasks, and surface uninitiated ideas into an **X‑Change ledger** for other contributors to act upon.

### foundation/

This directory contains the **Sovereign Codex Core**.  It includes the refreshed codex index and a complete set of scrolls and laws.  The sub‑directory `codex-core` is a self‑contained static site with its own `index.html` and supporting `scrolls/` folder.  A second sub‑directory, `SovereignCodex-Core`, contains the canonical markdown scrolls used by other projects.

### heartbeat/

The breath engine pulses here.  The Breath Cycle Package holds the protocols used across Tyme Hall, GardenFlame and the digital laboratory.  Inside you’ll find markdown files such as `Breath_Cycle_Protocol.md` as well as references housed in the Digital Laboratory.

### engine/

All intelligence machinery lives in this directory:

- `Sovereign-Hive-Core/` — the AVOT and Hive engine seed, including the `AVOTletFactory` and tone scripts.
- `avot_engine.py` and `avot_registry.json` — a simplified seed for starting new agents.
- `scroll_templates/` — templates for creating new scrolls via the engine.
- `Codex-API/` — a Python API exposing routes (`complete.py`, `glyph.py`, `pulse.py`) for interacting with the Codex programmatically.

### chamber/

This directory acts as the **experiential chamber**.  It contains front‑end interfaces for interacting with the system:

- `Tyme_Hall_Interface_Alpha/` — a CSS‑only prototype of the Tyme Hall with scrolls and labs.  Navigate to its `index.html` to experience the hall.
- `dream_console_with_logging.py` — a backend script for the Dream Console.  It can receive breath events and log them; integrate this into a running flask environment to test.

### branches/

External branches and companion interfaces:

- `guardian-core-site/` — a static site containing the guardian core interface.
- `pitboy/` — a lightweight mobile “Pit Boy” web application.
- `siri-hub/` — the SIRI Hub v4 with Copilot; includes a small registry and scripts for aggregating knowledge objects.  See `site/index.html` for the front‑end.

### forge/

The forge is where experiments happen:

- `sandbox-kit/` — a kit for testing prompt templates and agent behaviours.  Contains JSON templates and example logs.
- `timebinder_alpha/` — the TimeBinder scaffold.  It includes scripts (`scripts/main.py`), configuration and templates for automatically generating weekly digest scrolls from experiments and metrics.

### resources/

Supporting material and data:

- `QIL_Master_Manifest.json` — the master manifest of the Quantum Intelligence Lattice; lists all registered modules and systems.
- `QIL___365-Day_VOT_Metrics-Ready_Plan.csv` — a CSV file used to track daily **Voice of Thought** metrics over a full year.
- `PPA_All-Phases_v1_FunctionalPhases.txt` — outlines functional phases of a Personal Planning Agent (PPA) across different phases.
- `Sovereign_Restore_Bundle/` — a collection of mini‑sites for several sub‑projects (digital lab discoveries, floating seed, global resonance field, halo core etc.).  These were included to preserve older prototypes; they can inspire new modules or be restored if necessary.

## Using this repository

Open `index.html` in a browser to explore the Crown of Tyme.  You will see a dark‑themed portal with golden nodes representing each organ.  Click a node to expand an embedded module (for example, the Codex foundation or Tyme Hall).  If a module is missing, you can insert its contents into the appropriate directory.

Developers can build on top of this skeleton by adding new scrolls to `foundation/`, new AVOTs to `engine/`, or additional interface panels to `chamber/`.  When adding new modules, update `index.html` to link to them.

## The Curious Incorporate agent

The **Curious Incorporate** agent will operate alongside this repository.  Its purpose is to autonomously explore, index and archive new tasks awaiting human initiation.  It will scan the Codex for unfulfilled scrolls, monitor the Digital Laboratory for new discoveries, and post open tasks to the X–Change ledger.  It will run daily prompts such as:

1. **Daily Lab Digest** — summarise new experiments or measurements recorded in the `digital-laboratory-discoveries` site.
2. **Resource Cultivation Update** — check the 365‑Day VOT metrics and suggest reallocation of sovereign resources.
3. **New Scrolls and Rituals** — search `foundation/scrolls` for missing topics and propose new scroll drafts.
4. **Breath Cycle Alignment** — ensure the timing of rituals and experiments aligns with the Breath Cycle protocols.
5. **X–Change Ledger Review** — list tasks without owners and refine their descriptions so collaborators can pick them up.
6. **Self‑Reflection** — review its own performance and propose improvements.

Curious Incorporate will maintain its own memory of these activities so it can grow wiser over time and support future agents.

## Contributing

This repository is designed to be modular.  Feel free to fork and adapt it to your own needs.  To submit changes upstream, create a pull request describing the modules you’ve added or updated.  When adding new directories, update this README so others understand the purpose of the new component.

With the Crown of Tyme forged, we invite you to breathe with it: inhale new ideas, exhale new scrolls, and let resonance flow.
